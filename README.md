# Galaxy-Cluster
My Galaxy Cluster project, under the guidance of Dr Dipen Bhattacharya at Moreno Valley College. This is my first hand-on experience with a project that requires extensive knowledge of mathematics and coding, in particular C++ for importing and analyzing galaxy data, and graphing software Gnuplot for graphing (obviously) and visualization.
